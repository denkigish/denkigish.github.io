During the pandemic, 

I decided to pursue my data analytics certificate. As part of that journey, I was pushed to create a webpage to share with the world. I first started the page using Wordpress. I had used it before, and i knew how to get around. I got tired of paying so much to host such a simple website. I decided to look at my options and i was convinced to look at static webpages. This is my new site, created using Jekyll. Lets see where this journey takes me. Welcome, and good travels.
